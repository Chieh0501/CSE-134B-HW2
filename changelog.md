Changes to Site:

Modified the about page to be a slideshow as I believe it would make the site more concentrated and more professional.
Instead of ordering a section on each corner, compiling all the information in one place is also easier to access.

Third party javascript added: Google Analytics
I believe that Google Analytics is essential to a portfolio site as it can provide me with essential content such as:
    Number of views of the site
    Type of devices accessing the site (important for understanding which device I should center the site around)
    Understand percentage of viewers who downloaded the Resume
    Understand the distribution of the audience so I can modify the site accordingly.
